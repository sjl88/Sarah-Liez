<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Sarah</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Environmental Science and Writing</h2>
  <h3>Hi guys! My name is Sarah and I am a undergraduate senior in the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences majoring in Environmental Science and Public and Professional Writing. I am also minoring in Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies and pursuing a certificate in Public Communication of Science and Technology. This semester, I am very excited to work as a UTA for Writing for the Sciences and as a UTA for Communication for Environmental Professionals, two courses I greatly enjoyed last semester. After graduating this spring, I plan on pursuing a masters degree in a related field. I am currently looking at programs in the environmental studies and communications fields in Canada and the Netherlands.</h3>
  <h3>In my free time, I like to read, travel, listen to podcasts, go hiking, do yoga, and spend time with my pets. I am also a Senior Staff Writer for the Pitt News Opinions Desk and Service Chair for the Phi Sigma Pi honor fraternity.</h3>

  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I don't have much personal experience in digital design or coding, but I am very excited to learn and soon see myself as a "girl who codes." While I am primarily a writer who specializes in scientific and journalistic communication, I am looking to add digital composition to my skillset, which will undoubtedly expand my access to different modes of communication. My typical mediums include literary analyses, long-form opinion journalism, and research writing. I've always loved to combine professional and creative elements of writing in order to communicate my thoughts and ideas in a creative and thoughtful manner, which is largely why I enjoy writing for the Pitt News Opinions Desk. I think that this course will certainly provide additional ways for me to communicate issues of interest in a creative and engaging manner.</h3>

  <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <h3>For our final project, I am considering creating an interactive file, the type used at a kiosk, to educate people on the impacts of factory farming. I completed an internship this summer with the Factory Farming Awareness Coalition (FFAC) and would like to use what I learned in that experience to educate others on the problematic nature of the industry. This issue is important for a number of reasons, including its impact on the environment, on minority communities, and on animals themselves. This subject matter must be approached delicately while still being clear in stating the facts of the issue, so I am looking forward to figuring out how I would like to frame this issue based on my intended audience.</h3>

How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: center">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>In the future, I hope to do advocacy work in the field of environmental communications. After my experience this summer in an advocacy program with the FFAC, I would ideally like to write articles or oversee communications for a nonprofit group related to the environmental sector. Some potential fields of interest include factory farming, climate change policy, and sustainable urban planning. These areas connect to my personal interests by sustaining my love of animals, respect for the environment, and personal interest in urban sustainability. I am hoping this course can aid in accomplishing my goals by expanding my knowledge of digital communications and how to best use different modes of digital communication in disemminating information regarding these issues.</h3>
